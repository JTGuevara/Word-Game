# Word-Game
A word game developed in C++.
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The game consists of a player being given a continuous sequence of scrambled words of which the player must unscramble. A timer will 
  be set for each word given where the player has only a few seconds to unscramble each word before the timer runs out or else the game 
  ends. Points will be awarded for each word solved in proportion to the length of each word. Finally, the game will keep score of the 
  total accumulated amount of points.</p>

<h2>SETUP</h2>
<p>The game uses C++ libraries from C++11 and later, so make sure those are supported by your development tool or environment. 
  Source files are located in the project's /src/ directory.</p> 
<p>If building from the command-line, navigate to the game's /src/ directory and compile only WordGame.cpp. (Include directives are already
  set.)</p>
